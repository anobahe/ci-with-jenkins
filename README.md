# Continuous Integration Using Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube, and Slack

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for a Java web application using Jenkins. The pipeline incorporates multiple tools to enhance software quality, facilitate automation, and enable seamless deployment processes.

## Benefits of Continuous Integration
- **Shorter Mean Time to Repair (MTTR):** Faster identification and resolution of issues.
- **Agility:** Rapid adaptation to changes and feature updates.
- **No Human Intervention:** Automated workflows reduce manual errors.
- **Fault Isolation:** Early detection of faults in the development process.
- **Faster Turnaround on Feature Changes:** Quick integration and deployment of new features.

## Tools Used
- **Jenkins:** Continuous Integration tool to automate the build and deployment process.
- **GitHub:** Version control system to manage source code and trigger builds via webhooks.
- **Maven:** Build automation tool to compile and package the Java application.
- **Checkstyle:** Static code analysis tool to enforce coding standards.
- **AWS EC2:** Cloud computing service used to host Jenkins, Nexus, and SonarQube.
- **Nexus Sonatype:** Artifact repository manager for storing build artifacts and managing dependencies.
- **SonarQube:** Code analysis tool to measure code quality and enforce quality gates.
- **Slack:** Communication tool for receiving build notifications.

## Steps to Implement CI Pipeline

### 1. AWS Setup
1. Log in to AWS.
2. Create a key pair for secure SSH access.
3. Configure security groups to allow necessary traffic (Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube).
4. Launch an EC2 instance and include a user data script to install Jenkins, Nexus, and SonarQube.

### 2. Post-Installation Configuration
1. **Jenkins:**
   - Install necessary plugins.
   - Configure Jenkins with required credentials and job setup.
2. **Nexus:**
   - Set up repositories for artifact storage and maven dependencies.
3. **SonarQube:**
   - Log in and verify dashboard accessibility.

### 3. GitHub Integration
1. Create a GitHub repository and push the source code.
2. Integrate VSCode with GitHub and test code changes.

### 4. Jenkins Build Job Configuration
1. Configure Jenkins to pull code from GitHub.
2. Integrate with Nexus for storing build artifacts.
3. Add a GitHub webhook to trigger builds automatically.

### 5. SonarQube Integration
1. Add SonarQube analysis stage in the Jenkins pipeline.
2. Configure quality gates to ensure code meets standards.
3. View results in the SonarQube dashboard.

### 6. Nexus Artifact Upload
1. Configure Jenkins to upload build artifacts to Nexus.
2. Verify artifact storage in Nexus repository.

### 7. Slack Notifications
1. Configure Slack webhook in Jenkins.
2. Send build notifications to the designated Slack channel.
